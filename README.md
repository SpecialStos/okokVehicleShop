## TCVS Integration with okokvehiclehsop
Please make the necessary changes to the specified event in the client-side open-source code.

Additionally, incorporate the specific manual event ("okokVehicleShop:server:TCVS:addVehicle") into the server-side open-source code.

These changes are designed to guarantee that vehicles automatically spawn with the selected color (if chosen). Be aware, however, that these adjustments will not automatically warp the player inside the vehicle.
